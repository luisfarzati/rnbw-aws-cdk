## AWS CDK

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

### Useful commands

- `yarn cdk:test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
